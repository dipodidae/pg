# âœ… Orb-Based Level Progression System - COMPLETED

## ðŸŽ¯ System Overview
The orb-based level progression system is now **fully functional** and allows players to advance to the next level by touching special orbs placed throughout the levels. The system includes:

- **Visual Orbs**: Animated, glowing orbs with pulsing and floating effects âœ…
- **Collision Detection**: Touch-based interaction when player gets close to orb âœ…
- **Level Progression**: Automatic loading of target level specified in SVG data âœ…
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: R key for restart, N key for next level âœ…
- **Canvas Rendering Fix**: Resolved PIXI.js async initialization issue âœ…

## ðŸŽ® How to Test (Game Running at http://localhost:5176/)

### 1. Basic Orb Interaction âœ…
1. Start the game at http://localhost:5176/
2. Navigate the player (WASD/Arrow keys + Space/W/Up to jump) to the end of level 1
3. Find the cyan glowing orb on the final platform at position (1500, 460)
4. Walk the player into the orb
5. **Expected Result**: Player should automatically progress to level 2 ("Sky Temple")

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts âœ…
1. During gameplay, press the **R** key
2. **Expected Result**: Current level should restart (player position resets, score resets)
3. Press the **N** key
4. **Expected Result**: Should advance to next level (if available)

### 3. Visual Effects âœ…
1. Observe the orb while playing
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Orb should pulse in size (scale animation)
   - Orb should have a glowing effect with changing intensity
   - Orb should float slightly up and down
   - Cyan color scheme with multiple layered circles

### 4. Level Progression Flow âœ…
1. **Level 1 â†’ Level 2**: Touch orb in level 1 to progress to "Sky Temple" level
2. **Score Reset**: Score should reset to 0 when advancing levels
3. **Progress Saving**: Level progress should be saved automatically
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if target level cannot be loaded

## âœ… Implementation Status - ALL COMPLETE

### Core Components
- âœ… **Orb Entity** (`src/entities/Orb.ts`): Complete with animations and collision detection
  - Pulsing scale animation with Math.sin
  - Glowing intensity effects
  - Distance-based collision detection (40px threshold)
  - Proper cleanup with destroy() method
- âœ… **SVG Integration** (`src/levels/SVGLevelLoader.ts`): Orb extraction from level files
  - extractOrbs() method processes SVG circle elements with "orb" class
  - convertElementToOrb() converts SVG data to LevelOrbData
  - Integrated into loadLevel() return data
- âœ… **GameScene Integration** (`src/scenes/GameScene.ts`): Orb collision handling and level transitions
  - setupOrbsFromLevel() instantiates orbs from level data
  - Update loop handles orb collision detection
  - loadTargetLevel() handles level transitions
  - Proper orb cleanup in clearLevel()
- âœ… **Input System** (`src/core/Game.ts`, `src/core/types.ts`): Extended with R/N key support
  - Added 'restart' and 'next' to InputState interface
  - KeyR and KeyN mapped in setupInputHandling()
  - One-time press detection in GameScene to prevent key repeat

### Level Content
- âœ… **Level 1 SVG** (`public/levels/level1.svg`): Contains progression orb with `data-target-level="2"`
  - Multi-layered orb design (outer glow, main body, inner highlight)
  - Positioned at (1500, 460) on final platform
  - Proper class="orb" and data-target-level="2" attributes
- âœ… **Level 2 SVG** (`public/levels/level2.svg`): Advanced "Sky Temple" level ready for progression

### Technical Fixes
- âœ… **PIXI.js Canvas Issue**: Fixed async initialization problem
  - Made initPixiApp() async and call await this.app.init()
  - Moved SceneManager creation to start() method after app initialization
  - Proper error handling for canvas access
- âœ… **ESLint Compliance**: All linting errors fixed
  - Fixed unused error parameters in catch blocks
  - Fixed color literal casing (0x00ffff â†’ 0x00FFFF)
  - Fixed import order issues
  - Fixed getBounds() type mismatch
- âœ… **TypeScript Types**: Proper type definitions for all components

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

1. **Animated Orbs**: Pulsing (scale), glowing (alpha), floating visual effects
2. **Touch-Based Progression**: Distance-based collision detection (threshold: 40 pixels)
3. **Data-Driven Levels**: Target level specified in SVG `data-target-level` attributes
4. **Keyboard Controls**: R for restart, N for next level (one-time press detection)
5. **User Instructions**: In-game text explains all controls to players
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of orbs when clearing levels
7. **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling in level loading and transitions

## ðŸš€ System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The orb-based level progression system is now **complete and fully functional**! Players can:

- âœ… Navigate to the cyan orb at the end of level 1
- âœ… Touch it to automatically progress to level 2 ("Sky Temple")
- âœ… Use R to restart and N to advance levels manually
- âœ… Enjoy smooth animated orbs with visual effects
- âœ… Experience seamless level transitions with score reset
- âœ… Play without any console errors or rendering issues

### Next Steps
The core orb system is complete. Future enhancements could include:
- Multiple orbs per level with different targets
- Orb collection effects/animations
- Sound effects for orb collection
- Achievement system for collecting all orbs
